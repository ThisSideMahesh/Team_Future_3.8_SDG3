/**
 * SwasthyaSetu - Firestore Security Rules
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict, patient-centric security model where consent is paramount.
 * The default posture is "deny all," with access granted explicitly based on user roles and
 * data ownership. Patients have ultimate control over their personal data and consent settings.
 * Health Providers can only access patient data when permitted, and all such access is logged for auditing.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into top-level collections for primary entities: `patients`, `healthProviders`,
 * `healthRecords`, `accessLogs`, and `labReports`. This segregation allows for distinct and granular
 * security rules per entity. Patient-specific data that they directly control, such as consent,
 * is stored in a subcollection (`/patients/{patientId}/consents`) to leverage path-based
 * security for clear ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All operations are denied unless an `allow` rule explicitly permits them.
 * - Strict Ownership: Users (patients and health providers) can only access and manage their own
 *   profile documents (`/patients/{userId}` or `/healthProviders/{userId}`).
 * - No Public Listing: To prevent data scraping and protect user privacy, listing documents
 *   in top-level collections like `patients` and `healthProviders` is disabled.
 * - Immutable Logs: The `accessLogs` collection is append-only. Once a log is created,
 *   it cannot be modified or deleted, ensuring a secure audit trail.
 * - Backend-Managed Records: Health records are considered sensitive and are managed exclusively
 *   by trusted backend services (Cloud Functions). Direct client writes are disabled. Patients
 *   are granted read-only access to their own records.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To ensure fast and secure authorization checks, this ruleset relies on denormalized data.
 * - `healthRecords` documents contain a `patientId` field, allowing rules to verify patient
 *   ownership without performing extra reads.
 * - `accessLogs` documents contain both a `patientId` and a `healthProviderId`, allowing both parties
 *   to view a relevant log entry and enabling rules to verify the creator of the log.
 * This approach avoids slow and costly `get()` calls within rule evaluations.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The design uses separate collections for different data types (e.g., `patients`, `healthRecords`,
 * `accessLogs`) instead of a single collection with role-based flags. This provides stronger
 * security boundaries, simplifies rules, and makes list operations inherently safer, as each
 * collection can have its own specific listing permissions.
